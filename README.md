# KCommon

KCommon is a standard plugin library, initially written for PrisonKore.
The purpose of this core is to provide an easy-to-use module based plugin structure as well as some useful utilities.

## Modules

Modules are the foundation of the KCommon library.
Each module should represent a distinct feature of a plugin.
In fact, each module could be thought of as its *own* plugin.

## Building

To create a copy of this plugin, clone the repository and run

    ./gradlew build

This will create a built jar in /build/libs/
